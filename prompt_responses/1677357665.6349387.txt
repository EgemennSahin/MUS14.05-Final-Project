Hi
These days
Are you mad?
What happened?
If you the man then call me.
Yeah

I am a young man
Fucking incredible man that I think I could take on
If I do get to put your name down and make you feel this way


I'm still live my life. I can't deny it


Yeah, yeah


Fucking crazy man that I think I could take on


Call me Michael Jackson


Yeah


If I do get to put your name down and make you feel this way

I'm still live my life

And make it a damn thing


Mm oh


And make it a damn thing



I'm still live my life

 and make it a damn thing



I'm still livin' my life

And make it a damn thing
