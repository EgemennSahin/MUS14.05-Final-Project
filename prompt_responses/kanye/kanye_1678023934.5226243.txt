I'm still alive, my life stills mine
So don't say I'm finished, I'm still alive
And if I'm gonna do another one tonight
Then I'm gonna do one last one tonight
And if I'm gonna do another one tonight
It ain't the only one, it's the only one




I'm still alive, my life stills mine
So don't say I'm finished, I'm still alive
'Cause I'm gonna do one last one tonight
And if I'm gonna do another one tonight
Then I'm gonna do one last one tonight
It ain't the only one, it's the only one


I'm still alive, my life stills mine
So don't say I'm finished, I'm still alive
'Cause I'm gonna do one last one...


I'm still alive


'Cause I'm gonna do one last one, I'm going for them all the time


I'm still alive
