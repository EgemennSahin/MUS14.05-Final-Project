You don’t wanna  be locked in that  segregated prison. We want everybody here at this table who is under twenty or under. We want everybody ‘cause we wanna bring everybody back. We want to bring back the black community. And we want to bring back the African-American community. We want to bring back the children of  South Carolina. We want to bring back that  African-American community. We want to bring back that whole thing, bring back  the kid of  North Carolina who, in the city of Charlotte, he wasn’t there last summer! He was there. I’m gonna bring the   Black community back. That’s where I’ll bring back... Let me return again, let me return again. Let me - let me... Let me return again.  We want to bring back a good ending of that moment and just for the people who do the work to tell people
