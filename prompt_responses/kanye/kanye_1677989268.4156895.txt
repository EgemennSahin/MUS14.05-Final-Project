    I'm like you, I got       I got my number on your back
    But how much of an effect do I have on your life?
    Well, let me tell you something, you know how this situation goes
    You know how this situation goes, because it's not really me and you

I'm supposed to   speak to you       to tell you what you know to know
Or             like
